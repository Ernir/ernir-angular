## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deploy

Run `npm run deploy` to collect static material and deploy the current branch to [ernir.net](https://ernir.net/). Deployment uses [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages).

## Format

Run `npx prettier --write .` to format the codebase.
